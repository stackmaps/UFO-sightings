# UFO-sightings

Intermediate Python learning project introducing basic Machine Learning (ML).

This project teaches you about a machine learning technique called logistic regression by using data from UFO sightings. 

## Difficulty Level:  INTERMEDIATE

To understand this project, you should have experience with algebra. To write the code, you should have experience with writing Python and using libraries. 

## The Story

You see something strange out of the corner of your eye and can’t seem to figure out what it is. After checking your surroundings, you see that the time is 2:20pm. This strange flashing has been going for 5 minutes now. The weather is normal, and there are no vehicles or buildings in sight. Quickly, you send your precise location to your friend in order to document this strange sighting. Your latitude is 36.595° and your longitude is -82.1889°. Could this be a UFO sighting, or is your mind playing tricks on you?  To begin, read the notes later on this page to understand what a logistic regression is. 

## What you will learn

In this project, you will:
* Understand the machine learning concepts of training data and test data.
* Understand what a logistic regression does and is used for.
* Understand a simple validation metric and why it should be used.
